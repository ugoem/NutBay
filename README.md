# Description

NUTsBAY is a social platform where professional nutritionist and herbalist come together to share ideas about natural solution to several health challenges facing humankind. The sole purpose of the platform is to create a niche where those who believe specifically on the use of natural resources to advance and preserve human health, can connect freely with each other as well as the general public to offer free and paid services to their prospective beneficiaries.

# My Story
I grew up in the small village of Onu-ogba, located on the western outskirts of Enugu Town, Nigeria. As a kid, while growing up, I did follow my parents to farms where we cultivated different types of crops, tubers, shrubs, vegetables, etc. 

There were lots of fruits, nuts, and shrubs around the neighbourhood and I enjoyed feasting on them as well as all our other farm produce. This made me grow up very healthy, and hearty with strong cognitive ability. I realized that I hardly fell sick, but coming to the city at a later age, I lost access to some of those natural items partly due to location and cost at times. 

At adult age, after spending some years in the township, I came to realize that am no longer strong and healthy as I use to be those days...this aroused my curiosity and even though I had an engineering background at school, I began probing the connection between natural substances, human health, and cognitive ability.

When I figured out the relationship, I became an advocate of natural delicacies. Hence when we were asked to come up with a portfolio project, I thought it wise to create a platform that will be solemnly dedicated to nature enthusiasts. Using it as a medium to create awareness and grow people's thoughts and ideas about the importance of going natural in virtually all they consume. 

Sharing the idea with Nnenna one of my team members, she quickly jumped in because she was already running a blog dedicated to natural living called Living Good. (put a link here). And so, the idea was transformed into a web project called NUTsBAY.
